# MeasureMate

The MeasureMate is a low-cost IoT sensor kit that is being developed by PULSAQUA, a company located in Rotterdam focused on enviromental monitoring. The goal of the MeasureMate project is to empower citizens and organizations to easily conduct autonomous measurements of water quality variables, and communicate these variables back to PULSAQUA. By doing this, citizens and organizations can participate in science projects without needing to be professional scientists (Citizen Science).

## Current Key Features

* Easy to Build: Completely open-source and DIY build kit.
* Easy to Use: A plug-and-play sensor kit for anyone to measure water quality.
* Real-time Data: Transmit data via WiFi or 4G for up-to-date monitoring.
* Versatile Sensors: Currently includes pH, temperature, pressure, and EC sensors for accurate environmental monitoring.
* Data Visualization: Visualize measurements on the Blynk platform through an app or web dashboard.
* Green Energy: Uses solar panel as a power source.
* Expandability: Plans for adding more sensor modules and a new visualization system.
* Citizen Science: Encourages involvement in environmental monitoring and research by allowing anyone to contribute valuable data.

## Future Vision 

* LoRaWAN connection.
* Sonar, hydrophone and dissolved oxygen sensors.
* New data storage system.
* New data visualization system.
* User-manuals
